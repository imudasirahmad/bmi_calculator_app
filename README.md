Introducing my new BMI Calculator App developed using Flutter! ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to share with you the BMI Calculator App I've created using Flutter. ðŸ“± This innovative tool is designed to help individuals monitor and manage their body mass index (BMI) effectively.

ðŸ¤” What is BMI?
BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a numerical value of a person's weight in relation to their height. It is a screening tool that categorizes individuals into weight status categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.
